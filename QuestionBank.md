# Project Question Bank

1. **An overview of your project on creating a knowledge graph for the Indian Railways network?**
The project involves constructing a knowledge graph representing the Indian Railways network. The graph is built using GeoJSON files containing information about trains and stations. The project includes loading the GeoJSON data, processing it to extract meaningful triples, and then using these triples to create and visualize the knowledge graph with tools like Neo4j and pyvis.

2. **What is the dataset used for this project, and in what format was it available?**
I used datasets for trains and stations in the Indian Railways network, which were available in GeoJSON format. The trains dataset contains information about train routes, while the stations dataset includes details about individual railway stations.

3. **Explain the process of loading and processing the GeoJSON files?**
The process begins with a function that loads GeoJSON files and filters out invalid LineString geometries. Valid geometries are converted into a GeoDataFrame using the `geopandas` library. This involves checking each feature's geometry type and ensuring it contains at least two coordinate points before creating a LineString object.

4. **How did the construction of the directed graph representing the Indian Railways network took place?**
I constructed the directed graph using the `networkx` library. Nodes represent stations and include attributes like state, code, zone, address, and geometry. Edges represent train connections between stations, with attributes such as train number, departure time, arrival time, and duration. The graph is built by iterating over the stations and trains DataFrames, adding nodes and edges as appropriate.

5. **What are RDF-like triples, and how were they generated in the project?**
RDF-like triples are statements in the form of (subject, predicate, object) that describe relationships between entities. In my project, I generated triples by extracting node and edge data from the directed graph. For each node, I created a type triple and attribute triples for its properties. For each edge, I created a connection triple and attribute triples for its properties.

6. **How were the triples exported and in what format?**
I exported the triples as an Excel file. This was done by creating a DataFrame with columns for the subject, predicate, and object of each triple and then saving the DataFrame to an Excel file using `pandas`.

7. **Describe the process of creating the knowledge graph in Neo4j?**
The process involves reading the Excel file containing the triples, sanitizing the relation types by replacing non-alphanumeric characters with underscores, and then using the `neo4j` driver to create the knowledge graph. For each triple, I used a Cypher query to merge nodes and relationships into the Neo4j database.

8. **How was the knowledge graph visualized, and what tools were used?**
I visualized the knowledge graph using the `pyvis` library. I converted the triples into a format suitable for visualization, created a directed network, added nodes and edges, and then saved the visualization as an HTML file. The graph was customized with attributes like node color and edge labels for better clarity.

9. **What challenges I face during this project, and how did I overcome them?**
One of the main challenges was handling the large volume of data and ensuring the accuracy of the geometries in the GeoJSON files. I overcame this by implementing robust error handling and filtering out invalid geometries. Another challenge was optimizing the creation and visualization of the knowledge graph, which I addressed by limiting the number of triples for demonstration purposes and using efficient data processing techniques.

10. **What are the potential applications of the knowledge graph you created?**
The knowledge graph can be used for various applications, such as optimizing train routes, analyzing connectivity between stations, and enhancing decision-making processes for railway operations. It can also serve as a foundation for building more advanced applications like recommendation systems for travelers or predictive maintenance systems for railway infrastructure.
